      <t>
        This specification defines a new Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework
        extension, 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the
        SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a
        single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media,
        referred to as bundled media, specified by multiple
        SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).
      </t>
      <t>
        To assist endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this
        specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only',
        which can be used to request that specific media is only
        used if bundled. The specification also updates RFC 3264,
        to allow usage of zero port values without meaning that
        media is rejected.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are multiple ways to correlate the bundled RTP
        packets with the appropriate media descriptions. This
        specification defines a new Real-time Transport Protocol
        (RTP) source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header
        extension that provides an additional way to do this
        correlation by using them to carry a value that
        associates the RTP/RTCP packets with a specific media
        description.

  <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>
     When multimedia communications are established, each 5-tuple reserved for an individual media stream
     consume additional resources (especially when Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
     <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> is used). For this reason, it is
     attractive to use a 5-tuple for multiple media streams.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification defines a way to use a single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for
    receiving media specified by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" pageno="false"
    target="RFC5888"/> extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
    to negotiate the usage of a BUNDLE group. Within the BUNDLE group, a BUNDLE address is used
    for receiving media specified by multiple "m=" lines. This is referred to as bundled media.
  </t>
  <t>
    The offerer and answerer <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> use
    the BUNDLE extension to negotiate the BUNDLE addresses, one for the offerer (offerer BUNDLE
    address) and one for the answerer (answerer BUNDLE address), to be used for receiving
    the bundled media specified by a BUNDLE group. Once the offerer and the answerer have
    negotiated a BUNDLE group, they associate their respective BUNDLE address with each "m=" line
    in the BUNDLE group. The BUNDLE addresses are used to receive all media specified by
    the BUNDLE group.
  </t>
  <t>
    The use of a BUNDLE group and a BUNDLE address also allows the usage of a single set of
    Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/>
    candidates for multiple "m=" lines.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification  also defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to
    request that specific media is only used if kept within a BUNDLE group. The specification
    also updates RFC 3264, to allow usage of zero port values without meaning that media is rejected.
  </t>
  <t>
    As defined in RFC 4566 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/>, the
    semantics of assigning the same transport address (IP address and port) to multiple
    "m=" lines are undefined, and there is no grouping defined by such means. Instead, an
    explicit grouping mechanism needs to be used to express the intended semantics. This
    specification provides such an extension.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification also updates sections 5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 3264 <xref format="default" pageno="false"
    target="RFC3264"/>. The update allows an answerer to assign a non-zero port value to an "m=" line in an
    SDP answer, even if the "m=" line in the associated SDP offer contained a zero port value.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification also defines a new Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref format="default"
    pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/> source description (SDES) item, 'MID', and a new RTP SDES header
    extension that can be used to associate RTP streams with media descriptions.
  </t>
  <t>
    SDP bodies can contain multiple BUNDLE groups. A given BUNDLE address MUST only be associated
    with a single BUNDLE group. The procedures in this specification apply independently to a given
    BUNDLE group. All RTP based media flows described by a single BUNDLE group belong to a single
    RTP session <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    The BUNDLE extension is backward compatible. Endpoints that do not support the extension
    are expected to generate offers and answers without an SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute, and
    are expected to associate a unique address with each "m=" line within an offer and answer, according
    to the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/> and
    <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
  </t>
  </section>


    <section title="Terminology" toc="default">
    <t>
      "m=" line: SDP bodies contain one or more media descriptions. Each media
      description is identified by an SDP "m=" line.
    </t>
    <t>
      5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source
      port, destination address, destination port, and transport-layer
      protocol.
    </t>
    <t>
      Unique address: An IP address and port combination that is associated with
      only one "m=" line in an offer or answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Shared address: An IP address and port combination that is associated with
      multiple "m=" lines within an offer or answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Offerer BUNDLE-tag: The first identification-tag in a given
      SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute identification-tag list in an offer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Answerer BUNDLE-tag: The first identification-tag in a given
      SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute identification-tag list in an answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Offerer BUNDLE address: Within a given BUNDLE group, an IP address and
      port combination used by an offerer to receive all media specified
      by each "m=" line within the BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      Answerer BUNDLE address: Within a given BUNDLE group, an IP address and
      port combination used by an answerer to receive all media specified
      by each "m=" line within the BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      BUNDLE group: A set of "m=" lines, created using an SDP Offer/Answer
      exchange, which uses the same BUNDLE address for receiving media.
    </t>
    <t>
      Bundled "m=" line: An "m=" line, whose identification-tag
      is placed in an SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute identification-tag list
      in an offer or answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Bundle-only "m=" line: A bundled "m=" line with an associated
      SDP 'bundle-only' attribute.
    </t>
    <t>
      Bundled media: All media specified by a given BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      Initial offer: The first offer, within an SDP session (e.g. a SIP dialog
      when the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC3261" /> is used to carry SDP), in which
      the offerer indicates that it wants to create a given BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      Subsequent offer: An offer which contains a BUNDLE group that
      has been created as part of a previous offer/answer exchange.
    </t>
    <t>
      Identification-tag: A unique token value that is used to identify an
      "m=" line. The SDP 'mid' attribute <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC5888" />, associated with an "m=" line, carries
      an unique identification-tag. The session-level SDP 'group' attribute
      <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888" /> carries a list
      of identification-tags, identifying the "m=" lines associated with that
      particular 'group' attribute.

  <section title="SDP Grouping Framework BUNDLE Extension" anchor="sec-group" toc="default">
    <t>
      This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension
      <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/>, 'BUNDLE'. The
      BUNDLE extension can be used with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate
      the usage of a single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving bundled media.
    </t>
    <t>
      A single address:port combination is also used for sending bundled media. The address:port
      combination used for sending bundled media MAY be the same as the BUNDLE address, used to receive
      bundled media, depending on whether symmetric RTP <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC4961"/> is used.
    </t>
    <t>
      All media associated with a BUNDLE group MUST be transport using the same
      transport-layer protocol (e.g., UDP or TCP).
    </t>
    <t>
      The BUNDLE extension is indicated using an SDP 'group' attribute
      with a "BUNDLE" semantics value <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC5888"/>. An identification-tag is associated with each bundled
      "m=" line, and each identification-tag is listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE'
      attribute identification-tag list. Each "m=" line whose identification-tag
      is listed in the identification-tag list is associated with a given
      BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      SDP bodies can contain multiple BUNDLE groups. Any given bundled "m="
      line MUST NOT be associated with more than one BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      NOTE: The order of the "m=" lines listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute
      identification-tag list does not have to be the same as the order in which
      the "m=" lines occur in the SDP.

    <t>
      This section defines a new SDP media-level attribute <xref target="RFC4566" pageno="false"

    <t>
      In order to ensure that an answerer that does not support the BUNDLE extension always
      rejects a bundled "m=" line, the offerer can assign a zero port value to the "m="
      line. According to <xref target="RFC3264" pageno="false" format="default"/> an answerer
      will reject such "m=" line.
      By associating an SDP 'bundle-only' attribute with such "m=" line, the offerer can
      request that the answerer accepts the "m=" line if the answerer supports the Bundle
      extension, and if the answerer keeps the "m=" line within the associated BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      NOTE: Once the offerer BUNDLE address has been selected, the offerer does
      not need to include the 'bundle-only' attribute in subsequent offers. By
      associating the offerer BUNDLE address with an "m=" line of a subsequent offer,
      the offerer will ensure that the answerer will either keep the "m=" line within
      the BUNDLE group, or the answerer will have to reject the "m=" line.
    </t>
    <t>
      The usage of the 'bundle-only' attribute is only defined for a bundled "m=" line with
      a zero port value, within an offer. Other usage is unspecified.

        <t>
          If all of the criteria above are fulfilled, the answerer MUST select the address
          associated with the "m=" line as the offerer BUNDLE address. In the answer, the
          answerer BUNDLE-tag represents the "m=" line, and the
          address associated with the "m=" line in the offer becomes the offerer BUNDLE address.

            In the corresponding offer, the "m=" line is associated with a shared

        <t>
          As described in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>, RTP/RTCP packets
          are associated with RTP streams <xref format="default" pageno="false"
          target="RFC7656"/>. Each RTP stream is identified by an SSRC value, and each
          RTP/RTCP packet carries an SSRC value that is used to associate the packet with the correct
          RTP stream (an RTCP packet can carry multiple SSRC values, and might therefore be associated
          with multiple RTP streams).
        </t>
        <t>
          In order to be able to process received RTP/RTCP packets correctly it must be possible
          to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line, as the "m=" line and SDP attributes
          associated with the "m=" line contain information needed to process the packets.
        </t>
        <t>
          As all RTP streams associated with a BUNDLE group are using the same
          address:port combination for sending and receiving RTP/RTCP packets, the
          local address:port combination cannot be used to associate an RTP stream
          with the correct "m=" line. In addition, multiple RTP streams might be
          associated with the same "m=" line.
        </t>
        <t>
          Also, as described in [<xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-rtp-sessions-pt"/>],
          the same payload type value might be used by multiple RTP streams, in which case the payload
          type value cannot be used to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line.
        </t>
        <t>
          An offerer and answerer can inform each other which SSRC values they will use
          for an RTP stream by using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute <xref format="default" pageno="false"
          target="RFC5576"/>. However, an offerer will not know which SSRC values the
          answerer will use until the offerer has received the answer providing that information.
          Due to this, before the offerer has received the answer, the offerer will not be
          able to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line using the SSRC value associated
          with the RTP stream. In addition, the offerer and answerer may start using new SSRC
          values mid-session, without informing each other using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
          In order for an offerer and answerer to always be able to associate an RTP stream
          with the correct "m=" line, the offerer and answerer using the BUNDLE extension MUST
          support the mechanism defined in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-receiver-id"/>,
          where the offerer and answerer insert the identification-tag (provided by the remote peer)
          associated with an "m=" line in RTP and RTCP packets associated with a BUNDLE group.
        </t>
        <t>
          The mapping from an SSRC to an identification-tag is carried in RTCP
          SDES packets or in RTP header extensions (<xref format="default" pageno="false"
          target="sec-receiver-id"/>). Since a compound RTCP packet can contain multiple
          RTCP SDES packets, and each RTCP SDES packet can contain multiple chunks, an
          RTCP packet can contain several SSRC to identification-tag mappings. The offerer
          and answerer maintain tables mapping RTP streams identified by SSRC,
          to “m=“ lines identified by the identification-tag. These tables are
          updated each time an RTP/RTCP packet containing one or more mappings
          from SSRC to identification-tag is received. Note that the mapping
          from SSRC to identification-tag can change at any time during an RTP
          session.

          Once an offerer or answerer recieve an RTP/RTCP packet carrying an identification-tag
          and an SSRC value (an RTCP packet might carry multiple identification-tags and SSRC values), it creates a
          mapping between the SSRC value and the identification-tag, in order to associate the RTP stream
          with the "m=" line associated with the identification-tag. Note that the mapping might
          change mid-session if, for a given SSRC value, a different identification-tag is provided in
          an RTP/RTCP packet.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an offerer and answerer is not able to associate an RTP stream with an "m=" line (using
          the mechanisms described in this section, or using other appropriate mechanism, e.g, based
          on the payload type value if it is unique to a single "m=" line), it MUST either drop the
          RTP/RTCP packets associated with the RTP stream, or process them in an application specific
          manner, once non-stream specific processing (e.g., related to congestion control) of the packets
          have occurred. Note that RTCP packets can report on multiple RTP streams.

      <t>
        SDP Offerers and Answerers <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
        can associate identification-tags with "m=" lines within SDP Offers
        and Answers, using the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC5888"/>. Each identification-tag uniquely represents an "m=" line.
      </t>
      <t>
        This section defines a new RTCP SDES item <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC3550"/>, 'MID', which is used to carry identification-tags within RTCP
        SDES packets. This section also defines a new RTP SDES header extension
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC7941"/>, which
        is used to carry the 'MID' RTCP SDES item in RTP packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SDES item and RTP SDES header extension make it possible for a receiver to associate
        each RTP stream with with a specific "m=" line, with which the receiver has
        associated an identification-tag, even if those "m=" lines are part of the same RTP session.
        The RTP SDES header extension also ensures that the media recipient gets the identification-tag
        upon receipt of the first decodable media and is able to associate the media with the
        correct application.
      </t>
      <t>
        A media recipient informs the media sender about the identification-tag
        associated with an "m=" line through the use of an 'mid' attribute
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/>. The media sender then
        inserts the identification-tag in RTCP and RTP packets sent to the media recipient.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: This text above defines how identification-tags are carried in SDP Offers
        and Answers. The usage of other signalling protocols for carrying identification-tags
        is not prevented, but the usage of such protocols is outside the scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/> defines general procedures
        regarding the RTCP transmission interval. The RTCP MID SDES item SHOULD be sent in
        the first few RTCP packets sent after joining the session, and SHOULD be sent regularly
        thereafter. The exact number of RTCP packets in which this SDES item is sent is
        intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on the expected packet loss
        rate, the RTCP reporting interval, and the allowable overhead.
      </t>
      <t>
        The RTP SDES header extension for carrying the 'MID' RTCP SDES SHOULD be included
        in some RTP packets at the start of the session and whenever the SSRC changes. It might
        also be useful to include the header extension in RTP packets that comprise access points in the media
        (e.g., with video I-frames). The exact number of RTP packets in which this header
        extension is sent is intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on expected
        packet loss rate and loss patterns, the overhead the application can tolerate, and
        the importance of immediate receipt of the identification-tag.
      </t>
      <t>
        For robustness purpose, endpoints need to be prepared for situations where the
        reception of the identification-tag is delayed, and SHOULD NOT terminate sessions
        in such cases, as the identification-tag is likely to arrive soon.

          encoded, as in SDP.
        </t>
        <t>
          The identification-tag is not zero terminated. Note, that the set of header extensions
          included in the packet needs to be padded to the next 32-bit boundary using zero
          bytes <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5285"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          As the identification-tag is included in either an RTCP SDES item or an RTP SDES header
          extension, or both, there should be some consideration about the packet expansion
          caused by the identification-tag. To avoid Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issues
          for the RTP packets, the header extension's size needs to be taken into account when
          encoding the media.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is recommended that the identification-tag is kept short. Due to the properties of
          the RTP header extension mechanism, when using the one-byte header, a tag that is 1-3 bytes
          will result in a minimal number of 32-bit words used for the RTP SDES header extension,
          in case no other header extensions are included at the same time. Note, do take into
          account that some single characters when UTF-8 encoded will result in multiple octets.
          The identification-tag MUST NOT contain any user information, and applications SHALL
          avoid generating the identification-tag using a pattern that enables application
          identification.

      The security considerations defined in <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> and <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/> apply to the BUNDLE
      extension. Bundle does not change which information
      flows over the network but only changes which addresses and
      ports that information is flowing on and thus has very little
      impact on the security of the RTP sessions.
    </t>
    <t>
      When the BUNDLE extension is used, a single set of security credentials
      might be used for all media streams specified by a BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      When the BUNDLE extension is used, the number of SSRC values within
      a single RTP session increases, which increases the risk of SSRC
      collision. <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4568"/>
      describes how SSRC collision may weaken SRTP and SRTCP encryption
      in certain situations.

    <t>
      The usage of the SDP grouping extension for negotiating bundled media is
      based on a similar alternatives proposed by Harald Alvestrand and Cullen
      Jennings. The BUNDLE extension described in this document is based on
      the different alternative proposals, and text (e.g., SDP examples)
      have been borrowed (and, in some cases, modified) from those alternative
      proposals.
    </t>
    <t>
      The SDP examples are also modified versions from the ones in the Alvestrand
      proposal.

  <section  title="Design Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>
        One of the main issues regarding the BUNDLE grouping extensions has been whether,
        in SDP Offers and SDP Answers, the same port value should be inserted in "m="
        lines associated with a BUNDLE group, as the purpose of the extension is to negotiate
        the usage of a single address:port combination for media specified by the
        "m=" lines. Issues with both approaches, discussed in the Appendix have been
        raised. The outcome was to specify a mechanism which uses SDP Offers with both
        different and identical port values.
      </t>
      <t>
        Below are the primary issues that have been considered when defining the "BUNDLE"
        grouping extension:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>1) Interoperability with existing UAs.</t>
          <t>2) Interoperability with intermediary B2BUA- and proxy entities.</t>
          <t>3) Time to gather, and the number of, ICE candidates.</t>
          <t>4) Different error scenarios, and when they occur.</t>
          <t>5) SDP Offer/Answer impacts, including usage of port number value zero.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

        RFC 4961 specifies a way of doing symmetric RTP but that is an a later
        invention to RTP and Bob can not assume that Alice supports RFC 4961. This
        means that Alice may be sending RTP from a different port than 10000 or
        10002 - some implementation simply send the RTP from an ephemeral
        port. When Bob's endpoint receives an RTP packet, the only way that Bob
        knows if it should be passed to the video or audio codec is by looking at
        the port it was received on. This lead some SDP implementations to use the
        fact that each "m=" line had a different port number to use that port
        number as an index to find the correct m line in the SDP. As a result, some
        implementations that do support symmetric RTP and ICE still use a SDP data
        structure where SDP with "m=" lines with the same port such as:

    <section  title="Usage of port number value zero" toc="default">
      <t>
        In an SDP Offer or SDP Answer, the media specified by an "m=" line can be
        disabled/rejected by setting the port number value to zero. This is different
        from e.g., using the SDP direction attributes, where RTCP traffic will
        continue even if the SDP "inactive" attribute is indicated for the
        associated "m=" line.
      </t>
      <t>
        If each "m=" line associated with a BUNDLE group would contain different
        port values, and one of those port values would be used for a BUNDLE address
        associated with the BUNDLE group, problems would occur if an endpoint wants to
        disable/reject the "m=" line associated with that port, by setting the port
        value to zero. After that, no "m=" line would contain the port value which
        is used for the BUNDLE address.  In addition, it is unclear what would happen
        to the ICE candidates associated with the "m=" line, as they are also used for
        the BUNDLE address.

    <section  title="B2BUA And Proxy Interoperability" toc="default">
      <t>
        Some back to back user agents may be configured in a mode where if
        the incoming call leg contains an SDP attribute the B2BUA does not
        understand, the B2BUA still generates that SDP attribute in the Offer
        for the outgoing call leg. Consider a B2BUA that did not understand
        the SDP "rtcp" attribute, defined in RFC 3605, yet acted this way.
        Further assume that the B2BUA was configured to tear down any call
        where it did not see any RTCP for 5 minutes. In this case, if the B2BUA
        received an Offer like:

      It would be looking for RTCP on port 49172 but would not see any
      because the RTCP would be on port 53020 and after five minutes, it would
      tear down the call. Similarly, a B2BUA that did not understand BUNDLE yet
      put BUNDLE in it's offer may be looking for media on the wrong port and
      tear down the call. It is worth noting that a B2BUA that generated an
      Offer with capabilities it does not understand is not compliant with the
      specifications.

      <section  title="Traffic Policing" toc="default">
        <t>
          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUA, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g., IP address and
          port) in order to control traffic gating functions, and to set
          traffic policing rules. There might be rules which will trigger
          a session to be terminated in case media is not sent or received
          on the ports retrieved from the SDP. This typically occurs once the
          session is already established and ongoing.

          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUA, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g., codecs and
          media types) in order to control bandwidth allocation functions.
          The bandwidth allocation is done per "m=" line, which means that
          it might not be enough if media specified by all "m=" lines
          try to use that bandwidth. That may either simply lead to bad
          user experience, or to termination of the call.

    <section  title="Candidate Gathering" toc="default">
      <t>
        When using ICE, a candidate needs to be gathered for each port. This
        takes approximately 20 ms extra for each extra "m=" line due to the NAT
        pacing requirements. All of this gather can be overlapped with other
        things while for exampe a web-page is loading to minimize the impact. If the client
        only wants to generate TURN or STUN ICE candidates for one of the "m="
        lines and then use trickle ICE <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice" />
        to get the non host ICE candidates for the rest of the "m=" lines, it MAY do
        that and will not need any additional gathering time.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some people have suggested a TURN extension to get a bunch of TURN
        allocations at once. This would only provide a single STUN result so in
        cases where the other end did not support BUNDLE, may cause more use of
        the TURN server but would be quick in the cases where both sides
        supported BUNDLE and would fall back to a successful call in the other
        cases.
